## Project Overview
For our final project, we create a treasure hunt painting exploration game. The scene begins within a blank white area with nothing aside from a paint brush and a bucket filled with blue paint. Upon interacting with the brush, one will equip it to use. If the player interacts with the blue bucket, spilling the paint, it will activate the rest of the world for the player to explore, filling in the skybox.

This is the part when the player will warp into a different scene, this scene being the colorable world. In this scene, the player is dropped into the onboarding site where they can see different objects such as trees, a bridge, etc. The objects that are colored white are the ones that can be colored in. The player is equipped with a color pallete as well as a paint brush. As the player finds more colors, they are visible on the color pallete where they can be dipped into with the paint brush to be used. Colors are scattered around the map and have to be acquired in order to find the right colors for the colorable objects. Players can also explore the whole world and the different environment within it.

## Goals
There are two main goals in our game. The first being the player paints all objects in the surrounding that can be colorable so no white objects remain. The second goal is to explore the world and find all colors that are scattered in the scene. 

In terms of game controls, to pick up the paint brush, the player has to use the grab button and upon releasing this button, the brush locks into place after rotating itself to an upright position. To perform the actual painting action, the primary button has to be pushed to paint objects.
