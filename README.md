## Project Overview

Make sure to update, will fill in with initial proposal overview.
For our final project, we would like to propose a painting exploration, treasure hunt, survival-like game. The scene begins within a blank white area with nothing aside from a paint brush and a bucket filled with blue paint. Upon interacting with the brush, one will equip it to use. If the player interacts with the blue bucket, spilling the paint, it will activate the rest of the world for the player to explore, filling in the skybox.

This is the part when the floor will give in and the player will feel like they are falling down and land in a different scene. In this scene, the player will be able to see outlines of different shapes such as trees, mountains, lakes, etc. 


## Goals

There are various goals required to “win” the game. The primary goal of the game is to paint your surroundings so that objects can be interacted with. Once objects can be interacted with, the player can use their surroundings to help progress in the game. Other mechanics in the game that will help the player towards their goal is collecting colors, collecting objects to help with their journey, and defeating monsters.
